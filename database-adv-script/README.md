## Joins Queries
- This file contains a series of SQL queries demonstrating different types of JOINs (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN) to retrieve data from a simulated Airbnb database.

- Each query is designed to solve a specific data retrieval problem, as described in the comments within the joins_queries.sql file.

## Subqueries

- Find properties with average rating above 4.0 using a subquery.
- Find users with more than 3 bookings using a correlated subquery.

## Aggregations and Window Functions

- Count total bookings made by each user.
- Rank properties based on number of bookings using window functions.
